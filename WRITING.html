			<div class='sk-asset sk-This-song-was-inspir-3A0C3256-1859-4211-B776-C9131A927D40'><span class="span1">This song was inspired by the 1984 novel itself and was first planned to be a integral part of a complete album entirely inspired by Orwell's book itself. We can clearly see the 1984 novel inspiration and warning by the lyrics:  <br><br>You've read it in the tea leaves, and the tracks are on TV <br>Beware the savage jaw <br>Of 1984 <br><br>Here, we can understand that Bowie is warning the listener to what could happen if the universe that Orwell describes becomes true. He warns us of the savage jaw of the party and propaganda that was happening around that time around the world, notably the Vietnam war that was full of capitalist propaganda and resemblance to 1984 in the mind control, the sacrifice and the rationing. <br><br>By the melody and the background song we can understand the universe of the dark and sumptuous universe of the 1984 novel, by the off-rhythm bass and the minor chord we can understand that bowie`s inspiration was the dark and scaring world of Oceania’s London. In the Bowie’s Glam Rock style the search for provocative lyrics and style was omnipresent that is why bowie emphasised on the 1984 book who was provocative and a taboo subject in England at the time; that was banned a few years before the song’s publication. Bowie succeeded in that manner because the song makes us fear this reality. </span></div>
			<div class='sk-asset sk-This-song-was-compos-97114A9D-F46F-4A2B-8B86-9B05A4A351EC'><span class="span1"> <br>This song was composed by the red army choir in homage of their founder Mao Zedong. In the universe of 1984, a Environnement of control and devotion to the regime is in place. In the regime of communist China, it is about the same and the party, just as in the book 1984 control every tough, every idea and every gestures of every party members. In this song we can clearly see this in the lyrics : In our hearts is the sun Mao Zedong, He leads us to liberation, The masses stand up to be the owners, Oh we thank them!. We can clearly make a parallel with these sayings in the book 1984: War is peace, freedom is slavery, ignorance is strength. This is proven by the followinf lyrics: <br><br>The masses stand up to be the owners <br><br>This is a direct link with the 1984 novel because in it, big brother calls for the people of oceania to stand up and make the everyday sacrifices for the soldiers at the front, this song calls for the same thing. </span></div>
			<div class='sk-asset sk-The-song-22-5-is-2AA344CF-3D14-4E1F-A215-0AB560BC4E72'><span class="span1"> <br><br>The song 2+2 = 5 is a song by radioheasd that was presumably inspired by the 1984 novel and composed to denounce the standardization and mind control that was put into young people minds at the time; notably all the misinformation around the nine eleven attacks and the invasion of Afghanistan that followed; Eminem with his song “Mosh” denounces the same kind of problematic that was happening in America at the time. This is proven by the title of the song itself : 2+2 = 5: it directly refers to doublethink in the 1984 novel, where contradictory beliefs are simultaneously accepted as true. In the 1984 novel, the party tries to manipulate and control the minds of the people, here, 2+2=5 is a excellent example of the distortion of truth and the power of the authority exerts on the poor mind of the people.  This fact is also highly accentuated by the words of Yorke, a member of the Radiohead band: The people who don’t give a fuck … The lukewarm are on the edge of the Inferno, cruising around near the gates but they can’t actually get out. They’re like, ‘What are we doing here? We didn’t do anything at all. <br><br>The link’s with orwell’s novel becomes very clear when we look at these sets of lyrics:  <br><br>I'll stay home forever <br>Where two and two always makes up five <br><br>You have not been paying attention <br>Payin' attention <br><br>Those four lines highly emphasizes the fact that the lukewarm people as Yorke suggests (reference to the proles in the 1984 novel) are clearly a denounciation of the oppression and mind control made on the people. </span></div>
