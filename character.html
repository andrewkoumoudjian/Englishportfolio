Everywhere I go,I fear the telescreens that watches my every move, reminding me that I am never truly alone and our leader, big brother is watching us. I can feel the Party's eyes on me, waiting for me to slip up the permitted taught and then be taken out of society for taughcrime.  <br><br>As I write these words, I feel a twinge of fear. What if the Thought Police find this diary? What if they discover the truth about me and Julia? The mere thought of being surprised with my little rebel makes my blood run unbelievably cold. <br><br>  <br><br> <br><br>November 1st, 1984 <br><br>Dear diary, <br><br>Big brother doesn’t scare me at all. He may control our every move, but he won’t control my free mind that is thinking of rebellion every second of this vain life. Those thought overwhelmed me at work as I “accidently” made slip my pen on the newspaper that was supposed to be corrected in newspeak and “accidently” wrote: Damn you big brother ! <br><br> <br><br>November 2nd, 1984 <br><br>Dear diary, <br><br>It was a tiring day at the ministry of truth. We spent the entire day rewriting articles in newspeak. I don’t understand how and why we are doing this if we are destroying the sole purpose of speech by doing so. <br><br>Today after work, I went on a hunt for some razor blades in the black market because the legal market had run out of them, and my bear was getting spikier. The vendor offered me other illicit goods too like snow globes and old books. <br><br> <br><br> <br><br> <br><br>November 3rd, 1984 <br><br>Dear diary, <br><br>Work, work, work as always. The journey to work was quite unpleasant today; I passed into a slum, the road leading to the ministry was closed today because of a military parade celebrating the billionth offensive in the Sahara Desert. I'm beginning to think that all these stories of war are just there to scare us and make us work even harder for the ones on top to profit. <br><br>The lunch was like usual, quite bad as well, but it was made better by a few ounces of victory whiskey. <br><br> <br><br>November 4th ,1984 <br><br>Dear diary, <br><br>Work, again and again, we worked until our eyes couldn’t feel the pressure, we’ve been building upon them. The bombs have felled in the city, as I was walking a sudden and violent explosion projected me on the ground and made me deaf for a few milliseconds. I have always though that our impenetrable army was defending our land which such courage and fear that something of this nature would never happen to our beautiful city. Our many sacrifice at the home front; the cut in many rations like the chocolate ration or even in razor blades to save steel for our munitions, were in vain. I feel disappointed. <br><br> <br><br>November 5th ,1984 <br><br>Dear diary, <br><br>Today I visited Charrington’s shop, as usual there was many useless things for sale including a snow globe from the era before big brother’s accession to power and the thenth world war between oceania and eurasia. I bought it. Thinking of this kind of liberty of the past makes me have the energy and the power to continue working in this vain life. <br><br>I asked Cherrington again for some razor blades that were in such sortage after the party’s cut in supply. He didn’t have any. Instead, he promised me a room on the second floor of his shop that was free from any telescreen or the party’s syrveillance for only 20 pounds a month. I couldbt resist and thought in the moment of all the liberty I could possibly posses with Julia if she agreed to come here. Liberty was taunting  but the tought of being with julia without masking out my emotions was even more attractive. <br><br> <br><br>November 6th, 1984	 <br><br>Dear diary, <br><br>I now moved permanently on top of charrington’s  shop; I don’t want to go back to my dilapidated victory “mansion” that our “generous” party offered us. Even if it was supposed to be one of the most high-end housings in the whold of oceania, but it is no more than a rat hole with telescreens watching your every move, your every action. <br><br> <br><br> <br><br><br>November 15th, 1984 <br><br>Dear diary, <br><br>O’brien summoned me into his office and handed me a book. When I left his office I took closer look at the book and noticed that it was a fake front book and it was hiding another book written by none other than Goldstein himself. Resistance and standing up to the party and bug brother seems so much more attractive than sacrificing my whole life to defend the party ideals. Big brother doesn’t stand a chance against the might of the people, the common thought and our greatest weapon, our words. <br><br> <br><br> <br><br>November 20th,1984 <br><br>Dear diary, <br><br>What a night with Julia again, I don’t care about anything else right now unless it has Julia in it. The taste of liberty in this little room has been fantastic and I wouldn’t go back to my old slave way of life ever again. <br><br>Charrington seemed stressed out and anxious when I walked into the store, I wonder if he prepared a bad one for me. <br><br>As I write these words though police are climbing up the stairs and helicopters are hovering overhead. They are coming for me and for my beloved Julia. All is oveeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee <br><br> <br><br> <br><br> <br><br> <br><br> <br><br> </span></div>
